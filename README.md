# glutothyination-db


# Overview
This is a continuation of my original project here [Senior Internship Frontend](https://github.com/rohand2290/senior-internship-frontend).
I remade the API and frontend in Next.JS, with frontend code automatically generated by v0. 


# Usage
To set up the database, follow the instructions in [here](https://github.com/rohand2290/glutothyination-data-processing/).
This is a Jupyter notebook that will automatically generate the SQL tables for you provided you have Postgres installed.
Once that's done, run `npm install` and `npm run dev` to view the frontend.
